Subject: [RFC] kbdif: add multi-touch support

Hi, all!

I am working on adding multi-touch support to the existing
kbdif protocol and would like to request for comments on the
below patch.
The aim is to provide multi-touch support to unprivileged
domains which may employ multiple virtual displays.
Thus, the protocol should handle multiple virtual touch input
devices withing the same domain, so those can be mapped to
different virtual displays.

Thank you in advance,
Oleksandr
