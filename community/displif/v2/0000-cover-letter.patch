Subject: [PATCH v2] displif: add ABI for para-virtual display

This is the ABI for the two halves of a para-virtualized
display driver.
    
This protocol aims to provide a unified protocol which fits more
sophisticated use-cases than a framebuffer device can handle. At the
moment basic functionality is supported with the intention to extend:
  o multiple dynamically allocated/destroyed framebuffers
  o buffers of arbitrary sizes
  o better configuration options including multiple display support
    
Note: existing fbif can be used together with displif running at the
same time, e.g. on Linux one provides framebuffer and another DRM/KMS
    
Future extensions to the existing protocol may include:
  o allow display/connector cloning
  o allow allocating objects other than display buffers
  o add planes/overlays support
  o support scaling
  o support rotation
