Subject: [Xen-devel][PATCH v2 0/4] Unique-id and fixes to some protocols

Hi, all!

This series fixes inconsistency in section used while defining kbdif
XenBus entries and adds string "unique-id" XenBus entry missing in
displif and kbdif. It also changes sndif's "unique-id" field from
integer to string to be aligned with displif/kbdif.

Konrad, I added your r-b tags to *all* the patches, so please
let me know if I have to drop those (if this is not what you meant
on the mailing-list).

Juergen, could you please release ack the rest of the patches as these
are needed to add sound configuration to libxl/xl and extend input
to support multi-touch. These are the changes to header files which are
not involved in Xen build, so it seems to be safe.
This will also unblock ptorocol synchronization with Linux, so I can
push an extension to xen-kbdfront driver (disable feature).

Thank you,
Oleksandr Andrushchenko

Changes since v1:
 - Changed type of "unique-id" from uint32_t to string (Konrad)
 - Added r-b's

Oleksandr Andrushchenko (4):
  xen/kbdif: Move multi-touch device parameters to backend nodes
  xen/kbdif: Add unique input device identifier
  xen/displif: Add unique display connector identifier
  xen/sndif: Change stream's unique-id to string
