Subject: [PATCH v8] sndif: add ABI for Para-virtual sound

Hi, there!

We would like to bring back to life this thread.
We do hope that the re-worked version of the original patch
addresses all the issues discussed before.
What is more we already have a working version of the
frontend and backend which prove that the protocol works
(those are in the process of preparing to be pushed to
the community as well).

Hope you can review the changes and provide some feedback,
so finally sound devices find their way in the world of Xen

Best regards,
Andrushchenko, Oleksandr
Grytsov, Oleksandr

Andrushchenko, Oleksandr (1):
  This is ABI for the two halves of a Para-virtual     sound driver to
    communicate with each to other.
