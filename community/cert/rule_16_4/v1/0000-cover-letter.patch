Subject: [Xen-devel][RFC PATCH 0/4] Add missing default labels to switch statements

Hello, everybody!

We at EPAM Systems would like to present first series of patches targeting Xen
on ARM Functional Safety certification (ISO61508 based): implementation of
MISRA [1] C:2012 Rule 16.4 which requires that every switch statement has a
default label as a measure of defensive programming technique.

Current patch series is against the source code used by Xen hypervisor on ARM
only and does not include Xen tools and x86 implementation. Although the target
is limited to ARM it does touch the code common to other architectures as well.
